        The payment during the term must be made within their prepayment privilege to avoid a prepayment charge. 
        However, at the time of renewal, borrower(s) are permitted to pay down the principal as much as they want.

        Remember that a servicing issue isn't completed until after the relevant tool has successfully been used.
